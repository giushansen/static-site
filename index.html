            <hr class="title">
            
            <p><strong>Why purchase a ticket instead of just taking reservations?</strong></p>
            <p>Breizh Original Cr&ecirc;perie is a small space, and we want to create an intimate environment for our guests. Ticketing allows us to anticipate who is coming and to give guests an all-encompassing experience while being prepared. Paying ahead also eliminates the financial loss of no-shows.</p>
            <p><strong>How do I purchase a ticket for the pop-up event?</strong></p>
            <p>Step 1. Click on the link above "Purchase ticket here" and it will direct you to a form. Complete it with the information required accordingly and submit.</p>
            <p>Step 2. You will receive an email by our reservations department within 24 hours to confirm your seating, with a link to make payment of your tickets.</p>
            <p>Step 3. Click on the link provided in our email to make payment of the ticket. You have up to 24 hours to make full payment. Once payment is received then the meal ticket will be sent to you directly via the email you have provided.</p>
            <p><strong>Is there an age limit to the guests? Are children allowed?</strong></p>
            <p>No there is no age limit however, please be aware that it is a commercial open kitchen. There are hazards such as kitchen staff cooking openly and hot cookingware are accessible. It is recommended by the venue manager that only guests 12 years of age and above attend.</p>
            <p><strong>What days are you open?</strong></p>
            <p>Normally Friday evenings for dinner service.</p>
            <p><strong>How much does a ticket to Breizh Original cost?</strong></p>
            <p>The price will vary based on the ever changing seasonal menu.</p>
            <p><strong>What are the payment methods at the Restaurant?</strong></p>
            <p>Only cash is accepted at the premise sorry for any inconvenience while we take some time to set up credit card/ eftpos systems.</p>
            <p><strong>What does my ticket include? What if I want more food?</strong></p>
            <p>$35 covers an entire meal of appetizer, salad side, main galette, and dessert cr&ecirc;pes including water. There will be 2 menus to choose from. It does not include any other Beverages on our menu. Strictly BYO. You can purchase more dishes during the event while limited. There will be a bill presented at the end of the meal only for beverages or for extra meals.
            <p><strong>Can I get a refund once purchased? Can I exchange my ticket for a different night?</strong></p>
            <p>No, just as attending a sport event, concert or the theater, all sales are final. We cannot cancel your ticket or reschedule for another night. If you cannot come, we recommend that you transfer your tickets to someone else.</p>
            <p><strong>Will you accommodate allergies or special dietary restrictions?</strong></p>    
            <p>If you have any specific or serious allergy please include that in your bookings form 48 hours prior to the dinner. We will be able to accommodate vegetarians however no other dietary restrictions can be accommodated at this time. </p>
            <p><strong>What if I am late for my reservation?</strong></p>
            <p>It is with our intent for all our guests to experience the full menu and dining experience we have taken so much care to create. If you and your dining partner/s are more than 15 minutes late please be aware that we may have to start the service before you arrive.</p>
            <p><strong>What is on the menu?</strong></p>
            <p>The menu will vary. We find and source the best seasonal ingredients markets has to offer at any given time.</p>
            <p><strong>Do you take walk-ins?</strong></p>
            <p>No. Given the small size of the hired venue we will not be able to reserve aside a table for walk-ins.</p>
            <p><strong>Can I take photos in the restaurant?</strong></p>
            <p>Yes. While we do allow patrons to take photographs, we DO NOT allow flash photography so as to preserve the intimacy of the of the space for all our guests.</p>
            <p><strong>Where do I park?</strong></p>
            <p>I recommend Court Street it is free after 5pm. Otherwise along Lord Street or Lincoln Street too. Please note as it may be paid parking.</p>
            <p><strong>Is Breizh Original Cr&ecirc;perie available for private parties?</strong></p>
            <p>Yes, if you are interested in buying out the restaurant for the evening please email <u>booking@breizhoriginal.com.au</u>.</p>
