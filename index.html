            <hr class="title">

            <p><strong>Why purchase a ticket instead of just taking reservations?</strong></p>
            <p>Breizh Original Cr&ecirc;perie is a small space, and we want to create an intimate environment for our guests. Ticketing allows us to anticipate who is coming and to give guests an all-encompassing experience while being prepared.</p>

            <p>It is our intention that all our guests experience the full menu and dining experience that we have taken much care to create. We would request that our guests arrive on time to ensure smooth service throughout the evening.</p>
            <p><strong>Do you take walk-ins?</strong></p>
