            <p>Breizh is one region of 22 regions of France and where Galettes and Crêpes originate from. Breizh, Bretagne and Brittany all mean respectively the same place in Breton (native language), French and English.</p>
            <p>This french region is one of the 6 celtic nations along with Ireland (Éire), Scotland (Alba), Isle of Man (Mannin), Wales (Cymru) and Cornwall (Kernow).</p>
            <p>Brittany is a lively and wild place where history and so many legends live within a very diversified nature: Sea side with their famous pirates and sailors, breathtaking cliffs and beautiful islands. Mystical, green, dense forests <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broc%C3%A9liande">(Broceliande Forest</a>  where Merlin is buried) and Standing stones - "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnac_stones">Carnac Stones".</a></p>

            <p>900 Years ago, back from the Crusades, Buckwheat was introduce to France and therefore Brittany. Since this moment, by using it as a flour and making breads, this flower has saved the Bretons from starvation.</p>
            <p>During these centuries, they have perfected the buckwheat flour to an extent that makes these breeds today very different from where it is from, China.</p>
            <p>Today Crêpes and Galettes have been so many times copied but in Brittany, we are serious about it: We say there are as many recipes as there are bell tower in brittany.</p>
            <p>When we cook our Crêpes, we call it "turning". Everything matter in producing excellent Crêpes: High quality flours, good local ingredients and using the best tools and technique for the spreading of the batter.</p>
            <p>Join Breizh quality and help us ridding the world of cheap immitation. Become a good food advocate.</p>
            <p>Crepes are the pride of Breizh.</p>

            </h2>
            <hr class="title">
            <p>There are Crêpes restaurants called <strong>Crêperies</strong> in every part of France even though, as you would have guessed, they are a high concentration of them in Brittany. We are talking about thousands of them.</p>
            <p>Crêperie is a place similar to a cafe / brasserie or bistro/restaurant where Crêpes are the specialty where everybody gather to enjoy a good time.</p>
            <p>You can also recognized the better Crêperie with their signature items such as home made salted butter caramel sauce, home made chocolate sauce </p>
            <p>Yet, Crêperies in France and Breizh Original Crêperie in particular are a casual affair where our guests are here to be delighted.</p>
            <p>Dining in a Crêperie follow the French concept with a good company and a multi-course meal: One Galette with Cider (two for the hungrier) always followed with a Crêpe and most often ended by a cafe noir (espresso).</p>
            <p>You can also enjoy some appéritifs (tapas) and menu du jour (specials).</p>
