            <p>Breizh Original draws on traditional French-Bretagne comfort food with a modern twist. We simply want to reinterpret classic recipes using simple, local, farm-fresh ingredients and cutting edge culinary technology to create our galette and cr&ecirc;pe menu both highly creative and approachable.</p>
            <p>At the heart of our Cr&ecirc;pes is the food. We love our planet and want to be good stewards by carefully selecting ingredients that are nearly all farmed or harvested in a sustainable manner - care for lives led by animals raised for food and soil that is unblemished of unnecessary chemicals.</p>

            <p>Buckwheat flour is the staple of our institution. Our main product - Galette - its main ingredient - Buckwheat flour.</p>
            <p><strong>Where our Buckwheat is from?</strong></p>
            <p>The buckwheat flour we have selected to use are harvested purely from organic Australian farmers between Central Queensland to Northern Victoria. Blended by one source and milled locally so that the flour is the freshest of quality when we cook it.</p>
            <p><strong>What exactly is Buckwheat - Is it safe for people who cannot metabolize gluten?</strong></p>
            <p>Contrary to belief, Buckwheat is in fact a fruit seed that is related to rhubarb and sorrel, not a cereal grain. This seed's coat or hull is a green or tan color, which makes the flour when grinded, a dark brown or black color hence its name "bl&eacute; noir" (black wheat) or "sarrasin".  It is a nutritive powerhouse, Low GI, Gluten Free and easy to digest. <strong><u><a href="http://mysisterspantry.wordpress.com/2013/02/25/great-grains-buckwheat/">Read more...</a></u></strong></p>
            <p>Buckwheat can be safely eaten by people who have celiac disease as it does not contain gluten.</p>
            <p><strong>Taste of Buckwheat</strong></p>
            <p>Unroasted buckwheat has a soft, subtle taste, and roasted buckwheat gives an earthy and nutty taste. We use roasted buckwheat.</p>
            <p><strong>Health Benefits</strong></p>
            <p>The list of nutritious advantages buckwheat has to offer is exhaustive. Nutrients from Buckwheat helps support a healthy cardiovascular system. Contributes to better blood sugar control hence a lower risk of diabetes mellitus. Helps prevent gallstones. Whole grain foods are highly protective against childhood asthma while wheat, another whole grain is more so avoided due to it being a common food allergen associated with asthma. <strong><u><a href="http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&dbid=11">Read more...</a></u></strong></p>
            <p><strong>Why Organic Buckwheat?</strong></p>
            <p>Buckwheat grains grown in unblemished and  nutrient balanced soils are less rid of its vitamins, nutrients and antioxidants than conventional food that have been normally grown with 400 different chemicals . Organic food is good for you, good for farmers, and good for the earth. Organic foods tastes better because organic farming starts with nourishment of the soil - which leads to nourishment of the plant, and ultimately to your palate!</p>

            <p>Exceptional salt from the marshes of Southern Brittany harvested since before the ninth century by means without mechanization remains unique not only because of its geographical location but also of its traditions still honored by those who collect it.</p>
            <p>Less salty than Meditarranean salt, Gu&eacute;rande salt is softer on the palate and richer in flavor, which makes it preferred by cooks all over the world.</p>
            <p>Unwashed, unrefined and additive-free. Very rich in magnesium and trace elements. Therefore in March 2012, the Salt of Gu&eacute;rande obtained their IGP &#40;Protected Geographical Indication&#41; which guarantees the origin and quality of the salt. It is the first time this distinction has been granted for a salt in Europe. <strong><u><a href="http://www.frenchfoodintheus.org/spip.php?article3766">Read more...</a></u>
            </strong></p>
            <p>We use the Salt of Gu&eacute;rande in many signature galette recipes and in the making of our Salted Butter Caramel.</p>

            <p>Liquid gold, some call it, Salted Butter Caramel or Caramel au Beurre Sal&eacute; is a Cr&ecirc;perie signature. There is no serious Cr&ecirc;perie that do not do their own salted butter caramel sauce.</p>
            <p>Caramel itsef is already amazing. Who doesn't love its deep, intense flavor, the complexity in its sweetness - sweet yet never cloyingly sweet. Then came salt, an unexpectedly happy union, bringing out the best caramel and vice versa. <strong><u><a ref="http://jothetartqueen.wordpress.com/2012/01/10/caramel-au-beurre-sale-salted-butter-caramel/">Read more...</a></u></strong></p>
            <p>This combination is in fact not a novelty. In 2008, this substance took the world by storm with shops rolling out macarons, ice-cream and cupcakes. <strong><u><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/31/dining/31cara.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0">Read more...</a></u></strong></p>
            <p>However if we attempt to trace the origin of salted caramel, we would find that it has been around for ages in the North-West of France, Brittany. They have been making Caramel au Beurre Sal&eacute; since the seventies with their specialty produce butter - salted butter.</p>
            <p>We make our own Caramel au Beurre Sal&eacute; sauce with Australian butter, sugar, and a very special salt - Sel de Gu&eacute;rande, a direct produce of Brittany.</p>
            <p>Caramel au Beurre Sal&eacute; sauce is a condiment for many of our dessert specials as well as our traditional ones too.</p>

            <hr class="title">
            <img class="img-responsive img-border img-left" src="{{site.url}}/img/emmentalcheese.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Emmental cheese or the archetypal Swiss cheese being the oldest cheese, originated from Switzerland and across the border of France is traditionally made from unpasteurized cow's milk well-known for the marble-sized holes that dot its pale-yellow interior and has a mildly nutty, sweet flavor and a firm, silky texture. The aroma is often sweet with tones of fresh cut hay. It is made famous in cartoons showing cheese with holes and is easily identified that way too.</p>
            <p>It is considered to be one of the most difficult cheeses to be produced because of its complicated hole-forming fermentation process. <strong><u><a href="http://ifood.tv/shopping/299892-how-to-buy-emmental-cheese">Read more...</a></u></strong></p>
            <p>It is a common cheese ingredient we use on our galette recipes and is enjoyed by the kids as well as the adults.</p>

            <p><strong>Nutritional Value</strong></p>
            <p>Organic hens are fed organic feed - no animal byproduct or GMO crops, no antibiotics, which improves the quality of eggs.</p>
            <p>Studies suggest that the nutritional content of eggs from hens that forage daily on a grass range has higher levels of omega 3 and Vitamins A and E, and lower levels of total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, and omega 6.</p>
            <p><strong>Uses</strong></p>
            <p>Eggs are cooked onto Galettes for many classic recipes. Egg is also a required ingredient in the making of cr&ecirc;pe batter.</p>

            <p>Brittany produces virtually no commercial wine although there is the Muscadet. Cider however is the main drink of Brittany, widely drunk and drunk in a bowl! <strong><a href="http://heartofbrittany.com/foodanddrink.php>">Read more..</a></strong></p>
