            <p>Where our Buckwheat is from?</p>
            <p>Breizh Original is proud to reveal that one of our buckwheat grains supplier is a true Australian Organic Processing Organisation. For more than 30 years they have forged a hard earned reputation for professionalism and integrity of their organic products.</p>
            <p>Available throughout the year all over the world, our buckwheat is harvested purely from organic Australian farmers between Central Queensland to Northern Victoria.</p>
            <p>What exactly is Buckwheat - Is it safe for people who cannot metabolize gluten?</p>
            <p>Contrary to belief, Buckwheat is in fact a fruit seed that is related to rhubarb and sorrel, not a cereal grain. This seed's coat or hull is a green or tan color, which makes the flour when grinded, a dark brown or black color hence its name "bl&eacute; noir" (black wheat) or "sarrasin".  It is a nutritive powerhouse, Low GI, Gluten Free and easy to digest.
            <p>Buckwheat can be safely eaten by people who have celiac disease as it does not contain gluten.</p>
            <p>Its name is derived from the Dutch word brockweit, which means "beech wheat", reflecting buckwheat's beechnut-like shape and its wheat-like characteristics such as its size to wheat kernels and its possibilities of recipes as alternatives to using wheat products, while it does not contain any gluten at all.</p>
            <p>Taste of Buckwheat</p>
            <p>Sold in 2 forms - roasted and unroasted - Unroasted buckwheat has a soft, subtle taste, and roasted buckwheat gives an earthy and nutty taste.</p>
            <p>We use roasted buckwheat.</p>
