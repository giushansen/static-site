            <p>Breizh Original was born from a simple vision... Our love for truly scrumptious Creperie food and the way it is made.</p>
            <p>That is how we found our style in reproducing the best Creperie we can find in Brittany.</p>

            <p>A mother who cook for her children or their guest will always do her best to provide them with delicious food made of only the best ingredients.
            She will achieve that experience by doing everything it takes to make her children or guests comfortable,
            in order for them to enjoy what she has cooked with love and dedication.</p>
            <p>This is at least what Armelle, our Breton mother has always done and what we want to share today.</p>
