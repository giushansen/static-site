            <p>We say there are as many Crêpe recipes as there are bell towers in Brittany, a region where Crêpes have acquired cult status.</p>
            <p>Palatschinkens Austria, Mexican Tortillas Fajitas, Vietnamese Banh Xéo, Japanese Vegetable Okonomiyaki, Chinese Rice cr&ecirc;pe, American pancake, Moroccan Beghrir, Malaysian Roti, Belgian Waffles, Italian crespelle, Hungarian palacsintas, Jewish blintzes, Scandinavian plattars, Russian blini, and Greek kreps, are all the other names and adaptations of what pancakes go by. Crêpes are not only popular in France but elsewhere in Europe and throughout the world. <strong><a href="http://www.moniquescrepes.com/a-brief-history-of-crepes/">Read more...</a></strong></p>
            <p>The oldest buckwheat finds to date circa 2600BCE were found in Yunnan, China, on the edge of the Tibetan Plateau. <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckwheat">Read more.</a> </strong></p>
            <p>It was 900 Years ago, when the Crusaders returned to Europe from the Middle East &#40;<strong><a href="http://www.conservapedia.com/The_Crusades">Read more</a></strong>&#41; where they spread buckwheat as far as the Netherlands &#40;<strong><a href="https://www.wala.de/english/quality/plantlibrary/buckwheat/">Read more</a></strong>&#41;. Buckwheat was then first introduced to France and therefore Brittany at about the 12th Century. Since this moment, by using it as a flour and making breads, this flour has saved the Bretons from starvation.</p>
            <p>During these centuries, France have perfected the buckwheat flour to an extent that makes these breeds today very different from where it is from, China. &#40;<strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckwheat">Read more...</a></strong>&#41;</p>
            <p>Galettes are made from Buckwheat flour and crêpes are made from white wheat flour. Both are traditional products from Brittany, the area of Celtic origin located in the West of France.</p>
            <p>White flour crêpes appeared only at the turn of the 20th century when white wheat flour which formerly had been as expensive as sugar, honey or meat, became affordable. They are more commonly cooked for sweet ingredients.</p>
            <p>The generic name for galettes and crêpes nowadays is &ldquo;Crêpes&rdquo;, which you will see us use the different names interchangeably. Hence one calls a restaurant &ldquo;crêperie&rdquo; and not &ldquo;galetterie&rdquo;. <strong><a href="http://chefcrepe.com/history-about-crepes.htm?sm=1">Read more...</a></strong></p>
            <img class="img-responsive img-border img-left" src="{{site.url}}/img/galettesonbillig.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Crêpe making has evolved from being cooked on large cast-iron hot plates heated over wood fire in a fire place to hot plates which are now gas or electric heated. The batter is spread with a tool known as a rozel and flipped with a spatula.</p>
            <p>When we cook our Crêpes, we call it "turning". Everything matters in producing excellent Crêpes: High quality flours, good local ingredients and using the best tools and technique for the spreading of the batter.</p>
            <p>The wide array of ways to prepare the Crêpes is as great as the imagination of the gourmet who eats them. Everything, no matter how exotic is allowed. And the best traditional way to eat them is to serve them with glasses of dry cider.</p>
